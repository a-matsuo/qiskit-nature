    Adds a new problem class,
    :class:`qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.lattice.LatticeModelProblem`,
    for lattice models. It can create second quantized operators from a lattice model.
    We can use the Ground State Eigensolver with it to calculate the ground state energy.

    .. code-block:: python

        calc = GroundStateEigensolver(converter, solver)
        res = calc.solve(LatticeModelProblem(lattice_model))
